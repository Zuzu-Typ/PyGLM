# PyGLM Wiki  
### Welcome to PyGLM's wiki  
The wiki is continuously growing and improving\.  
  
I recommend starting at [PyGLM Types](PyGLM-Types.md) if you're new\.  
  
You can also have a look at the[reference of PyGLM's functions](function-reference/README.md)\.  
\(Or refer to the Python Help system or \_\_doc\_\_ fields if you need more info about individual functions\)\.  
``` Python
>>> help(glm.identity)
Help on built-in function identity in module glm:

identity(...)
    identity(matrix_type: type) -> matNxM
    Builds an identity matrix.
 ```  
  
Feel free to browse through the other wiki pages\.
