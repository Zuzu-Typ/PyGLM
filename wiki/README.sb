\h1\PyGLM Wiki\h1\
\h3\Welcome to PyGLM's wiki\h3\
The wiki is continuously growing and improving.

I recommend starting at \url PyGLM-Types.md \PyGLM Types\ url\ if you're new.

For a reference of all of PyGLM's functions, take a look over \url function-reference/README.md \here\ url\.
You can also refer to the Python Help system or __doc__ fields if you need more info about individual functions.
\code Python\
>>> help(glm.identity)
Help on built-in function identity in module glm:

identity(...)
    identity(matrix_type: type) -> matNxM
    Builds an identity matrix.
\code\

Feel free to browse through the other wiki pages.

Thank you for using PyGLM!
