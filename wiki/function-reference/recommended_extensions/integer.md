### iround\(\) function  
#### <code>glm.<code>**iround**(**x**: *number*) -\> *int*</code></code>  
&emsp;&emsp;Returns a value equal to the nearest integer to ``` x ```\. The fraction ``` 0.5 ``` will round in a  
&emsp;&emsp;direction chosen by the implementation, presumably the direction that is fastest\.  
&emsp;&emsp;``` x ``` must be greater than or equal to ``` 0 ```  
  
#### <code>glm.<code>**iround**(**x**: *vecN*) -\> *ivecN*</code></code>  
&emsp;&emsp;Returns a value equal to the nearest integer to ``` x ```\. The fraction ``` 0.5 ``` will round in a  
&emsp;&emsp;direction chosen by the implementation, presumably the direction that is fastest\.  
&emsp;&emsp;Each component of ``` x ``` must be greater than or equal to ``` 0 ```  
  
### uround\(\) function  
#### <code>glm.<code>**uround**(**x**: *number*) -\> *int*</code></code>  
&emsp;&emsp;Returns a value equal to the nearest integer to ``` x ```\. The fraction ``` 0.5 ``` will round in a  
&emsp;&emsp;direction chosen by the implementation, presumably the direction that is fastest\.  
&emsp;&emsp;``` x ``` must be greater than or equal to ``` 0 ```  
  
#### <code>glm.<code>**uround**(**x**: *vecN*) -\> *uvecN*</code></code>  
&emsp;&emsp;Returns a value equal to the nearest integer to ``` x ```\. The fraction ``` 0.5 ``` will round in a  
&emsp;&emsp;direction chosen by the implementation, presumably the direction that is fastest\.  
&emsp;&emsp;Each component of ``` x ``` must be greater than or equal to ``` 0 ```
